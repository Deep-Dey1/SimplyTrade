- Average price is recalculated on each buy transaction

- Password storage (production deployments should use hashing)
- User-specific data isolation via headers
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

### Performance Optimizations
- Lightweight vanilla JavaScript (no framework overhead)
- Single-page application architecture
- Efficient database queries with SQLAlchemy
- Static file serving for optimal load times
